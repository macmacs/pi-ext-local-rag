# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Fixed: a malformed PDF could kill the host agent process.** pdfjs rejects detached promises for per-page and per-XObject parse tasks that `pdf-parse` never awaits, so a corrupt content stream crashed the process with `FormatError: bad XRef entry` (or `Bad encoding in flate stream`) even though `extractText` already ran inside a `try`/`catch`. `extractText` now installs a scoped `unhandledRejection` guard for the duration of a parse that drops pdfjs-originated rejections and rethrows everything else, so genuine host bugs still crash as before.
- **Fixed: valid PDFs under ~64 KB failed with "bad XRef entry".** pdfjs resolves its sub-streams against `bytes.buffer` without honouring `byteOffset`, so a Node `Buffer` allocated from the shared pool made it read object data out of a neighbouring buffer. `extractText` now passes a standalone `Uint8Array`.
- **PDFs that fail to parse fall through to OCR** instead of being dropped from the index, and report the real parser message rather than "not found or unreadable".
- **Fixed `peerDependencies`**: declared `typebox` where the code imports `@sinclair/typebox`, and omitted `@earendil-works/pi-tui` entirely. With both missing, `index.ts` failed to import, so `__tests__/index.test.ts` and `__tests__/embedding.test.ts` could not run at all - two of four test files were silently dead. The suite runs and `npm run typecheck` is clean.
- **Fixed: `search.ts` imported the `Chunk` type as a value**, which breaks Node's TypeScript type-stripping (`node --experimental-strip-types`) even though bundlers tolerate it.
- `collectFromTracked` / `collectFromTrackedAsync` now take just the `trackedPaths` + `excludePatterns` slice of the config rather than a whole `RagConfig`, which is all they ever read.
- **Fixed: indexing could OOM-kill the host agent.** Embedding used a flat batch of 64 texts, and peak RSS scales with `batchSize x seqLen^2` (transformers.js pads every batch to its longest member), so a batch of full-length chunks allocated ~4.6 GB of attention scratch. On a 6 GB machine the rebuild died mid-run, after phase 1 had already deleted the old chunks - leaving an index with file rows but zero chunks, i.e. a silently empty RAG. `embedBatch` now sizes each batch against a memory budget (`PI_RAG_EMBED_BUDGET_MB`, default 384): a full 262-file / 1719-chunk rebuild peaks at ~1.0 GB instead of ~4.9 GB, and runs slightly faster because short chunks no longer get padded up to a long one.

### Known environment quirk

On a host whose CPU affinity is restricted (containers, LXC, `taskset`), onnxruntime-node logs `pthread_setaffinity_np failed ... Specify the number of threads explicitly` on the first inference. It is cosmetic - ORT falls back to unpinned threads and inference proceeds normally. It cannot be silenced from JS at onnxruntime-node 1.14: it comes from the global ORT thread pool, and neither `intraOpNumThreads`, `enableCpuMemArena`, `ort.env.logLevel` nor `ORT_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL` suppresses it.

## 0.4.1

- **Docs refresh**: README rewritten for 0.4.0 feature set — SQLite/FTS5/sqlite-vec storage, PDF/DOCX/HTML extraction, OCR fallback, per-project store, tracked paths + exclude patterns, 24 h auto-refresh, trailing-message auto-injection. Commands table expanded with `/rag find`, `/rag refresh`, `/rag rebuild --force`, `/rag exclude`, `/rag help`. Optional OCR install instructions (`brew install poppler tesseract tesseract-lang` / `apt install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr ...`). New "Testing" section noting `SKIP_EMBEDDING_TESTS` and the tesseract-absent OCR skip.
- **`package.json`**: description rewritten to mention SQLite + sqlite-vec + PDF/DOCX/HTML + OCR + per-project storage. Keywords += `sqlite`, `fts5`, `sqlite-vec`, `pdf`, `docx`, `ocr`.
- **`.gitignore`**: ignore `.pi/` so local RAG stores don't leak into commits.

## 0.4.0

- **SQLite storage** (replaces JSON): index now lives in a `rag.db` file using `better-sqlite3` + FTS5 virtual table for BM25 full-text search + `sqlite-vec` for vector similarity. Automatic one-shot migration from legacy `index.json` on first run, no data loss. WAL mode enabled for safe concurrent reads.
- **Per-project RAG store**: walks up from `process.cwd()` looking for `.pi/rag/`; falls back to `~/.pi/rag/` global store. First `/rag index` in a directory with no parent store creates one at cwd. Override with `$PI_RAG_DIR`.
- **Tracked paths + gitignore-style exclude patterns**: `trackedPaths` and `excludePatterns` in config; `/rag rebuild` re-walks tracked paths so new files are picked up automatically.
- **24h auto-refresh**: `before_agent_start` hook checks index age; re-indexes stale tracked paths in the background. `/rag refresh` command triggers manually. Configurable via `ragAutoRefresh`.
- **`/rag rebuild --force`**: wipes DB and re-embeds everything from scratch; fixes progress bar freezing during rebuild.
- **PDF + DOCX indexing**: `pdf-parse` for text PDFs, `mammoth` for DOCX files.
- **OCR fallback for image-only PDFs**: `pdftoppm` + `tesseract` pipeline for scanned documents (optional system deps).
- **HTML → Markdown via `turndown`** before chunking — cleaner chunks for web content.
- **`/rag find <glob>`**: list indexed files matching a glob pattern.
- **`/rag help`**: show all available subcommands.
- **`/rag` autocompletions**: working tab-completions for all subcommands.
- **Batched ONNX embeddings** (perf): `embedBatch()` now passes up to 64 texts per ONNX forward pass instead of 1-at-a-time (~64× fewer forward passes; ~219 passes for 13,955 chunks vs 13,955 previously).
- **Parallel file reads** (perf): Phase 1 of `indexFiles()` reads/chunks up to 32 files concurrently so I/O latency hides behind CPU work.
- **RAG context injected at end of prompt** (perf): avoids KV cache invalidation on models that support prefix caching.
- **Modular split**: `index.ts` refactored into 9 focused modules (`chunking.ts`, `embed.ts`, `indexing.ts`, `search.ts`, `store.ts`, `db.ts`, `config.ts`, `constants.ts`, `types/`).
- **104 tests** via vitest: covers chunking, math, BM25 search, SQLite storage round-trip, FTS5 triggers, vector normalization, PDF/DOCX/OCR extraction, per-project store resolution, 24h auto-refresh, and configurable extensions.
- **Fix**: tool definitions now include required `label` and `AgentToolResult.details` fields.
- **Fix**: silence `pdfjs` worker warnings in TUI.
- **Fix**: FTS5 query escaping for single quotes; split into individual terms.

## Unreleased

- **Configurable file extensions** (closes #9): expanded the default list to cover commonly-missing languages (`.cs`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.kt`, `.swift`, `.rb`, `.php`, `.lua`, `.dart`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.scala`, `.scss`, `.tf`, `.hcl`, `.mdx`, …) and added `extraExtensions` / `excludeExtensions` to `RagConfig` plus a `/rag ext list|add|remove|reset` subcommand so users can extend the allowlist without forking. Includes 6 new tests for `normalizeExt` and `resolveExtensions`.
- **Test suite** (38 tests, no dev dependencies — uses `node --test` + `--experimental-strip-types`): covers cosine/normalize math, chunking, file collection against real tmp dirs, BM25 search ranking + phrase boost, storage I/O round-trip + legacy `~/.pi/lens` → `~/.pi/rag` migration, and live embedding/semantic-search against the real ONNX model. The model (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ~23 MB) is fetched from HuggingFace on the first run; set `SKIP_EMBEDDING_TESTS=1` to opt out in offline CI. Run with `npm test`.
- **Storage paths overridable via env**: `PI_RAG_DIR` and `PI_RAG_LEGACY_DIR` let the index live somewhere other than `~/.pi/rag` (useful for project-local indexes and isolated tests).

## 0.3.0

- **Renamed `/lens` → `/rag`**: all commands now use `/rag index|search|status|rebuild|clear|on|off`
- **Renamed tools**: `lens_index` → `rag_index`, `lens_query` → `rag_query`, `lens_status` → `rag_status`
- **Storage migrated**: index data moved from `~/.pi/lens/` to `~/.pi/rag/` — existing index is automatically migrated on first run, no data loss
- **`/rag on|off`**: simplified toggle (previously `/lens rag on|off`)
- **No file limit**: removed the 500-file cap — indexes all files in a directory
- **Live progress**: `setWidget` + `setStatus` updates during `/rag index` and `/rag rebuild`; stderr overwrite line for tool mode (`rag_index`)
- **Event loop yield**: `await setTimeout(0)` between files so the TUI can re-render and the agent doesn't appear hung

## 0.2.0

- **Hybrid RAG**: BM25 + local vector embeddings via `@xenova/transformers` (Transformers.js)
- **Auto-injection**: `before_agent_start` hook injects relevant chunks into every LLM prompt
- **Embedding model**: `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim, ~23MB, downloads once, runs fully offline)
- **Score transparency**: search results now show `bm25`, `vector`, and `hybrid` scores
- **`/lens rag on|off`**: toggle auto-injection at runtime *(renamed to `/rag on|off` in 0.3.0)*
- **`/lens status`**: now shows vector coverage % *(renamed to `/rag status` in 0.3.0)*
- **Config file**: `~/.pi/lens/config.json` for `ragEnabled`, `ragTopK`, `ragScoreThreshold`, `ragAlpha` *(moved to `~/.pi/rag/` in 0.3.0)*
- Bumped to `dependencies` for `@xenova/transformers`
